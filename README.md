# Neural-network-for-MNIST
A neural network in Java, which recongnizes the MNIST handwritten digits. You can compete with the computer.

It uses the usual backpropagation and gradient descent method. It has a layer with 100 neurons connected to the pixel data, and then another layer with 10 neurons each connected to the previous 100 neurons. Each neuron in that last layer represents a number. It uses the rectified linear activation function.
