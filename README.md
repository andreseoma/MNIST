# Neural network for MNIST handwritten digit recognition
A neural network in Java, which recognizes the MNIST handwritten digits. You can compete with the computer.

It uses the usual backpropagation and gradient descent method. It has a layer with 100 neurons connected to the pixel data, and then another layer with 10 neurons each connected to the previous 100 neurons. Each neuron in that last layer represents a number. It uses the rectified linear activation function. And then it can be trained and it recognizes the handwritten digits very well, such that it is actually hard to compete with the neurons yourself.
